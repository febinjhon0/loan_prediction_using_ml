# loan_prediction_using_ml
Here i did a project to predict the loan eligibility using mechine learning algorithms
## methodology
The loan eligibility prediction model makes use of an analysis technique that modifies historical and present credit user information to create predictions. A significant issue in predicting loan eligibility is, making precise loan predictions using risk and evaluation analysis.
## Objective
Build models to predict clients who are likely to default on their loan and give recommendations to the bank on the important features to consider while approving a loan.
## Final results
To solve this project I built 3 machine learning models: logistic regression, decision tree and random forest (baseline and tuned versions). The best performance was obtained by the tuned decision tree model: 0.86 accuracy, 0.74 recall and 0.62 precision.

I chose this model due to its high interpretability and high recall that minimizes defaulters.
